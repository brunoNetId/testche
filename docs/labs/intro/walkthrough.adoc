= Camel Spring Boot - Simple Demo

Explore, build, test and deploy a Camel Spring Boot demo application using the Developer Sandbox and OpenShift Dev Spaces.

This hands-on lab is based on the following blog article in Red Hat Developers:

Assuming you have followed the article's instructions, you should be all ready to get hands-on with Camel Spring Boot in the OpenShift Dev Spaces workspace.

[time=2]
[id="explore-code"]
== Explore the source code

For illustration purposes the picture below shows what the integration end to end flow looks like.

The Camel route definition would define the entire end to end processing logic, which you can find in your project explorer here:

[id="terminal-stub"]
== Run the stub in your terminal

The stub acts as the backend service that provides the XML data we need to fetch.

{empty} +

. Open your terminal
+
Make sure you make visible your terminal in the IDE. You can toggle it using the keyboard keys kbd:[Ctrl + `] or simply find the option from the menu system as per the picture below:
+
image::images/01-toggle-terminal.png[align="left", width=40%]

. Let's first run the stub
+
Copy and paste the following command in your terminal to place yourself in the stub's Camel Spring Boot project:
+
[source, subs=]
----
cd stubs/end1<br>
----
+
{blank}
+
Then, copy/paste the following command to start the stub in the terminal:
+
[source, subs=]
----
mvn -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev -s configuration/settings.xml<br>
----
+
{blank}
+
--
* After _Maven_ downloads all the dependencies, you should see in your terminal logs the stub has started:
+
image::images/02-stub-terminal-logs.png[align="left", width=100%]
+
NOTE: Two notifications pop up informing about new listening ports. You can ignore the messages, they will automatically close after a few seconds.
--
+
{empty} +
+
Now, test your stub from a new terminal. From your terminal's top right corner, choose the Split option, as shown below:
+
image::images/03-terminal-split.png[align="left", width=40%]
+
{blank}
+
Copy/paste the following cURL command to obtain a response from the stub:
+
[source, subs=]
----
curl -s \
-H "content-type: application/xml" \
-d '' \
http://localhost:9000/camel/subscriber/details \
| bat -pP -lxml<br>
----
+
NOTE: The command also includes a pipe to colorise the XML output for better reading.
+
{blank}
+
The invocation should return an XML payload similar to:
+
----
<Individual>
    <Name>Some</Name>
    <Surname>One</Surname>
    <Address>
        <Number>1</Number>
        <Street>Some Street</Street>
        <City>Somewhere</City>
        <PostCode>SOME C0D3</PostCode>
        <Country>UK</Country>
    </Address>
</Individual>
----

{empty} +

[type=verification]
Did you obtain the same XML message as above shown?

[type=verificationSuccess]
You've successfully tested the stub !!

[type=verificationFail]
Inspect in stub logs to investigate possible failure causes.



[time=2]
[id="terminal-service"]
== Run the service in your terminal

The main _Camel_ service exposes a JSON REST API and integrates with the XML backend service (the stub).

{empty} +

. Run the main service
+
Copy and paste the following command in your terminal to place yourself in the main Camel Spring Boot project:
+
[source, subs=]
----
cd /projects/testche/level1simple/<br>
----
+
{blank}
+
Then, copy/paste the following command to start the stub in the terminal:
+
[source, subs=]
----
mvn -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev -s configuration/settings.xml<br>
----
+
{blank}
+
--
* Some more dependencies will be downloaded before the engine starts. When done, you should see logs of both systems in both terminals:
+
image::images/04-terminal-system-logs.png[align="left", width=100%]
+
NOTE: More notifications pop up about new listening ports. You can ignore the messages, they will automatically close after a few seconds.
--

+
{blank}
+
Open a third terminal from where you can issue commands, from your terminal's top right corner, choose the Split option, as shown below:
+
image::images/05-terminal-split-2.png[align="left", width=40%]
+
{blank}
+
Copy/paste the following cURL command to obtain a response from the stub:
+
[source, subs=]
----
curl -s \
-H "content-type: application/json" \
-d '{"id":"123"}' \
http://localhost:8080/camel/subscriber/details | jq<br>
----
+
NOTE: The command includes a pipe to parse the JSON response with JQuery, which nicely renders the returned JSON payload.
+
{blank}
+
The cURL command should return a JSON payload similar to:
+
----
{
  "fullName": "Some One",
  "addressLine1": "1 Some Street",
  "addressLine2": "Somewhere SOME C0D3",
  "addressLine3": "UK"
}
----

{empty} +


[type=verification]
Did you obtain the same JSON response as the one shown above?

[type=verificationSuccess]
You've successfully tested the main service !!

[type=verificationFail]
Inspect in stub logs to investigate possible failure causes.



[time=3]
[id="deploy-stub"]
== Deploy and test the stub

The stub acts as the backend service that provides the XML data we need to fetch.

{empty} +

. Stop both systems
+
Make sure you stop both the stub and the main service by selecting each terminal and pressing the keys keys kbd:[Ctrl + c]. Your view of your terminals should look like:
+
image::images/06-terminal-systems-stopped.png[align="left", width=100%]
+
{empty} +
+
. Deploy the stub
+
Make sure your CLI `oc` client (OpenShift client) points to your Developer Sandbox namespace:
+
[source, subs=]
----
oc projects -q | xargs oc project<br>
----
+
NOTE: The Developer Sandbox only ollows 1 namespace per user.
+
The command above should output something similar to:
+
----
Now using project "bmesegue-dev" on server "https://172.30.0.1:443".
----
+
{empty} +
+
You can now copy and paste the following command in your terminal to trigger the deployment:
+
[source, subs=]
----
mvn oc:deploy -Popenshift -s configuration/settings.xml<br>
----
+
{blank}
+
--
* You'll see Maven fetching more dependencies and then interact with OpenShift to finalise the deployment of the stub.
+
When done, if successful, going back to your browser's tab with your _OpenShift's_ developer topology view, you should see the new service up and ready when fully started, looking similar to:
+
image::images/07-topology-stub.png[align="left", width=20%]
--
+
{empty} +
+
. Test the stub
+
Copy/paste the following cURL command to obtain a response from the stub:
+
[source, subs=]
----
curl -s \
-H "content-type: application/xml" \
-d '' \
http://end1:8080/camel/subscriber/details \
| bat -pP -lxml<br>
----
+
NOTE: The cURL command above now points to the newly deployed pod, with its service `end1` listening on port 8080.
+
NOTE: The command also includes a pipe to colorise the XML output for better reading.
+
{blank}
+
The invocation should return an XML payload similar to:
+
----
<Individual>
    <Name>Some</Name>
    <Surname>One</Surname>
    <Address>
        <Number>1</Number>
        <Street>Some Street</Street>
        <City>Somewhere</City>
        <PostCode>SOME C0D3</PostCode>
        <Country>UK</Country>
    </Address>
</Individual>
----

{empty} +

[type=verification]
Did you obtain the same XML message as above shown?

[type=verificationSuccess]
You've successfully tested the stub deployed in the sandbox !!

[type=verificationFail]
Inspect in stub logs to investigate possible failure causes.


[time=2]
[id="deploy-service"]
== Deploy and test the main service

With the stub already deployed, we just need to deploy the service which will integrate with the stub running under the same namespace.

{empty} +

. Deploy the service
+
Ensure you run the commands below from the terminal located in the path of your main service project.
+
You can now copy and paste the following command in your terminal to trigger the deployment:
+
[source, subs=]
----
mvn oc:deploy -Popenshift -s configuration/settings.xml<br>
----
+
{blank}
+
--
* Maven will interact with OpenShift to deploy the service.
+
When done, if successful, going back to your browser's tab with your _OpenShift's_ developer topology view, you should see both services available, the main service and the stub, up and ready when fully started, looking similar to:
+
image::images/08-topology-service-stub.png[align="left", width=50%]
--
+
{empty} +
+
. Test the service
+
Copy/paste the following cURL command to obtain a response from the stub:
+
[source, subs=]
----
curl -s \
-H "content-type: application/json" \
-d '{"id":"123"}' \
http://simple:8080/camel/subscriber/details | jq<br>
----
+
NOTE: The cURL command above now points to the newly deployed pod, with its service `simple` listening on port 8080.
+
NOTE: The command also includes a pipe to parse and colorise the JSON output for better reading.
+
{blank}
+
The invocation should return an XML payload similar to:
+
----
{
  "fullName": "Some One",
  "addressLine1": "1 Some Street",
  "addressLine2": "Somewhere SOME C0D3",
  "addressLine3": "UK"
}
----
+
{empty} +
+
. Invoke an external service call
+
Notice the previous cURL command uses an internal service URL, which is not directly accessible by external consumers. However, the deployment process automatically creates a route in OpenShift that exposes the service to external consumers.
+
You can obtain the route details with the following command and use its URL from your favorite local HTTP client/tester, like podman or others.
+
[source, subs=]
----
oc get route simple<br>
----
+
Copy/paste the following cURL command to obtain a response from the stub:
+
[source, subs=]
----
curl -s \
-H "content-type: application/json" \
-d '{"id":"123"}' \
http://simple:8080/camel/subscriber/details | jq<br>
----
+
NOTE: The cURL command above now points to the newly deployed pod, with its service `simple` listening on port 8080.
+
NOTE: The command also includes a pipe to parse and colorise the JSON output for better reading.
+
{blank}
+
The invocation should return an XML payload similar to:
+
----
{
  "fullName": "Some One",
  "addressLine1": "1 Some Street",
  "addressLine2": "Somewhere SOME C0D3",
  "addressLine3": "UK"
}
----

{empty} +
